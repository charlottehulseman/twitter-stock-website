---------

Below are a few shortcuts on how to move around a computer via the text based interface known as the "terminal".
Basically all computers were like this but then Xerox invented the GUI and steve jobs put the first version of
a GUI Finder application in the Macintosh and no non-technical user has ever used the terminal since. 

The terminal is important because you can move around the computer very quickly and edit large numbers of files.

A few notes about terminology
  1) a directory is the same thing as a folder.
  2) everyfile has a type(pdf, xml, xlsx, txt, py) that shows what they are used for.
  3) emacs and sublime text are both "text editors" (aka where you write code)
  4) Anything in <brackets> you need to replace with something thats listed within the brackets.

All of these commands have what are known as arguments. Arguments extend the functionality of a command.
To find out more about any argument type "man <the command>" or "<the command> --help"

The shortcuts will be listed by purpose.
